## Made for all teams
* *No tech skills? No problem!* 
	* reqfire uses a non-technical language that everybody can understand. 
	* The model you create can be picked up by any team. 
* *Built for Business*
	* Focus on your requirements and needs and not just the technical implementation. 
	* Something else. 
* *Web and App development agencies* 
	* reqfire presents your requirements and use cases in a way easy for your client to understand. 
	* Something else

#### /Why developers prefer reqfire panel/
## Better specs create better tech
* *reqfire generates requirements models*
	* reqfire helps you capture your requirements as data and then links them to the other parts of your app to create use cases. 
	* Capturing your requirements as data lets reqfire generate 
		* Complete requirements models
		* Software requirement specifications
		* Use Case Diagrams (UML)
		* Traceability and Feature Approvals 
* *Develop without doubts*
	* Unambiguous use cases and documentation lets developers focus on building your product and less on trying to work out what was wanted (or something). 
* *Reusable templates and components*
	* Something here about that.

#### /Better websites and apps panel/
## Define together, build better
* *Design and approve first, code after*
	* Modelling the app with use cases is the fastest way to prototype an idea. 
	* Modelling your app with use cases is a faster way to prototype your ideas than wireframing or code. 
	* reqfire helps you do this even quicker by giving you overview if your designs and model meets your requirements.
* *Get buy-in and approval when it counts*
	* Having early and regular approval of your requirements and model leads to a better result and a happy client. 
* *Bring the whole team together*
	* Maybe something here about designers, PMS, BAs divs etc..

# How to _model_ a _social chat bot_  for _a client_ in 5 steps using reqfire
---
# 1. 
# Kick off with a template
## You know you are building a social app so you can start with a template project. reqfire’s template includes common use cases, interfaces and forms used with social apps. 
### Featuring: 
* Template library for common apps 
* Create your own templates 
* Boilerplate models make it easier to start

## Now you’re ready to bring your template to the client 
> /img will be a screenshot on the social app index page/
---
# 2.
# Gather requirements and approval
## Collect requirements straight into the app and then link to the other parts of your model. Record approval for your projects requirements. 
### Featuring: 
* Requirements management 
* Prioritise requirements and features
* Get client and team approval 
* Link requirements to components
 (e.g. “Home page is mobile-first” links to “Home-page Mobile” interface)
* External form for approval (coming soon) 

## With your project approved it’s time to analyse what you need. 
> /img will  Gather page/

---
# 3. 
# Connect your requirements to how the app looks and functions
## Now you can flesh out your app: upload your interfaces, detail forms, define business rules and include objects. 
### Featuring: 
* Linked components 
* Interface upload 
* Form editor 
* Business Rules  
* Objects (e.g. User records, credit cards, wifi routers) 
* Library items for all components (coming soon)

## With the app model taking shape you’re ready to connect it all together 
> /img will have interface upload and form editor/ 

---
# 4. 
# Define the activity of your app with use cases
## The use case editor allows you to connect your app in every way. Link to requirements, add users and actors, say what steps they are taking, and what components are used. 
### Featuring:
* Generates Use Case diagrams
* Use case editor
* Add user flows (including alternate flows)
* Activity steps
* Link requirements to use cases 
* Use case impact to project (coming soon) 
* Use case relative size (coming soon) 

## With the app all fitting together it’s time to release the model (or something) 
> /img will add a use case and then crack open the step edit - can we zoom in chrome ? would be cool/

---

# 5. 
# Showcase your work and get it built
## Show off all of your work with the requirements model that gets generated automatically. You can send this as an external link to your client. You can also send this as a build specification to your development team. 
### Featuring: 
* Generate complete requirements models
* Release history
* Version history
* External View via shareable link 

## In five steps you’ve completed a requirements model for your app 
> /Release page to external release/
